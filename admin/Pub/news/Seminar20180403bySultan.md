So, What Is CPEC?

China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, also known by the acronym CPEC, is a collection of infrastructure projects that are currently under construction throughout Pakistan. CPEC is intended to rapidly modernize Pakistani infrastructure and strengthen its economy by the construction of modern transportation networks, numerous energy projects, and special economic zones. On 13 November 2016, CPEC became partly operational when Chinese cargo was transported overland to Gwadar Port for onward maritime shipment to Africa and West Asia,  while some major power projects were commissioned by late 2017.


Background

China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is gaining great importance in the region but it is also inviting some internal and external threats. These potential threats can be seen from various perspectives such as cultural differences in China and Pakistan, political instability, geographical positioning of Pakistan, business environment and investment protection mechanisms. To foresee and address these potential threats, it is very important for China as well as for Pakistan to have a 
successful execution of CPEC and to gain prospects from it. With the expansion of this project, there will be an increasing number of Chinese corporations investing in Pakistan. Different cultural practices and ways of thinking could cause misunderstandings, and this could negatively affect CPEC projects. But, there is no proper platform available (specifically in Pakistan) that may enable Chinese and domestic business people to have specific information about possible investment opportunities. The general literature about CPEC is not much helpful for investors to 
make any investment and financial decisions.



In this conference, Dr. Sultan mainly focused on the following points:

- The impact of CPEC on the economy of Pakistan.
- Perception of Chinese and Pakistan investors about CPEC in general.
- Investors’ (Chinese, Pakistani) risk perception about investment risk in CPEC.
- The impact of CPEC on social and cultural aspects of both the nations.
- Possible policy recommendations for long-term business cooperation under CPEC from both Chinese and Pakistani perspective
